# Assignment7_API
# Async and Await Practice

This project is a practice exercise for working with asynchronous programming in Python using `asyncio` and `await`.

## Description

This Python script demonstrates the use of asynchronous programming techniques to perform various tasks, including:
- Finding rhymes for a given word using an external API.
- Fetching states and cities data for Iran from an external API.
- Getting coordinates (latitude and longitude) for a specific city in Iran.
